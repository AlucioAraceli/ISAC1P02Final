			<h1>Who is Makoto?</h1>
			<p> Makoto Nanaya is one of my three mains I currently use (as well as my first and oldest main) in the fighting game, "BlazBlue Chronophatasma Extend". Makoto is a straight up, rush down character (character who heavily plays on the offensive, closing in on the opponent and wailing down on them with attacks). Her fighting style is strongly of that of a boxer, akin to other fighters like Dudley from the Street Fighter series.</p>
			<h1>How to Makoto</h1>
			<p> Makoto is a very agile character who can move fast and get to where she needs to be. All of her attacks hit fast and quick, with short frame recoveries. Her Drive (a character specific ability/trait/attack) is called "Impact". Impact is Makoto's power punches, pressing and holding down the button starts a quick charge of a punch that can hit at charge levels one, two, and three. Holding the button causes a guaged to appear and quickly charge up, and once hitting three, will go back down until its empty, forcing the player to have to time when to release in order to get the level of punch they want. The purpose of this is that each level has different properties, level 1 just hurts, level 2 will stun an opponent and leave them open for a second, and level 3 not only REALLY hurts, but sends your opponent flying and skidding across the stage. Makoto also has various tools to help her get around, link moves and allow mixup. Astral vision is a command input that allows for Makoto to split into three verions of herself, one stayig grounded and running, one doing a far arching jump, and the last doing a high jump that won't go too far. Depending on the button pressed to do the input, affects which Makoto is the real one, (A = is the grounded, B = is the mid far arcing jump, C = is the high jump). The grounded one allows for Makoto to do one of four things with a follow up input, she can do a Drive punch, a simple jab, dodge through the opponent and be behind them, or do a flurry of punches. The far arcing jump is a useful way of closing the gap as well as acting as an anti-air to a jumping opponent. Finally that high jump is a good mix up move if your opponent has been blocking your current combo string, and now suddenly, Makoto can hit overhead, breaking the opponent's guard and leaving them open for a follow up combo. Finally Makoto has a single "projectile". Makoto makes a orb of energy that she can either leave as a trap, or force them to go into the air, or upon immeadiate cast, use her drive to punch it across the screen (charge level of the punch affects distance.)</p>
			<h1>How I play Makoto</h1>
			<p> My experience with Makoto really shows from the last section. My general strategy is to keep my opponent on the defensive while building up my super meter for my supers. During this build up point I use astral vision, specifially the grounded and high jump, for mix up in order to get past my opponent's defense and start to knock off their health. When I reach the point where I am able to, Makoto's supers are both easy and damaging to use in a combo. If one is new to the series this is a strategy that works for almost every character and their supers. Simply throw an opponent and then immediately (or in some cases their is a specific timing) input the super. For Makoto she needs to do hers immeadiately, as her most damaging super is a three phase series of punch, each punch can be charged to level 1, 2 or 3, each level does more damage. If done correctly, each punch will connect, if done wrong, one of two things will happen. The most common, is that the first punch will completely miss, and your opponent is going to go across the screen from the intiaiting throw. The second thing that can happen is that while the first punch will connect, the second punch will miss just barely, and due to the recovery animation of the super, your opponentwill have had enough time to recover and punish you (this is sadly more common as some characters have a smaller hitbox, my best friend uses a character with a thin hit box so yea...) 
			<h1>The Pros and Cons to Makoto</h1>
			<p> She is a good overal character, very balanced. She is a character who is easy to learn and helps to learn fundamentals with. Her biggest flaw is that she is an "honest" fighter. Being that she fights like a boxer, alot of her moves are very telegraphed and easy to see what she is doing. If she is punching and you are guarding, if she is going to hit low, you can clearly see her sprite going to hit low, making it easy to guard against. This makes players have to learn how to do mix up with her utilize her astral vision.
