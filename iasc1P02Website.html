			<h2>Who Is Bullet?</h2>
			<p> Bullet is one of my three mains I currently use (as well as the newest since she was just introduced in the vanilla release of the Cronophantasma) in the fighting game, "BlazBlue Chronophatasma Extend". Bullet is the mix of a rush down (character who heavily plays on the offensive, closing in on the opponent and wailing down on them with attacks) and a grappler (a character who specializes in grabs and throws for massive damage).</p>
			<h2>How to Bullet</h2>
			<p> Bullet uses her Drive (a character specific ability/trait/attack) called "Lockon". What lock on does is project a orange ring around her, and if an opponent is within the circle, as the name applies, they are locked onto, and unpon release, she will fly at them and do an attack. If this lands, she will gain a heat level. She has three levels, level zero, one and two. Upon reaching level one, she will have a orange aura around her. Every heat level does three things. Her dash speed and distance, is increased, her drive does more damage, and she now has access to new moves. At level two of heat, she is at her peak, and is able to preform a very punishing, and damaging super that can easily chunk a major amount of health, and on some characters, can outright kill them once they are at 45% health. </p>
			<h2>How I play Bullet</h2>
			<p> When I play Bullet, my general strategy is to keep my opponent on the defensive, while I try to build up heat levels. An issue with the heat levels is if I am in say heat level one, if I use lockon, an my opponent blocks the attack, I then lose that heat level. Bullet as a command input where she can manually add a level of heat. This of course leaves her open, so I make sure to do it a tthe end of a combo where I either knocked my opponent down and they need to recover, or I threw them. Bullet's forward throw tosses an opponent across the screen, giving me a change to build up heat with the input. With Bullet, players will want to build up heat, as well as use specific follow ups that expell the heat for extra damaage and or combo extenders, and even in some cases, lead into a super.</p>
			<h2>The Pros and Cons of Bullet</h2>
			<p> Bullet is a strong character, she hits hard for very few hits, and has an above average health point value. That being said, her biggest draw back is her reliance on this heat level system. At level zero, she has little mobility, and her drive attacks do low damage, as well as the size of the ring is small. Once a player builds up heat, it's only up from there. Depending on the match up it is either very easy to build up heat through lockon or the command input, or very difficult. Characters who have no projectiles and are slower, Bullet should have little to no problem building up heat levels. Against fast or projectile characters, timing WILL be very crucial, as they will be on Bullet as much as they can, to prevent her from heating up.</p>
