			<h1>Who is Taokaka?</h1>
			<p>Taokaka is a high mobile, versatile fighter. She can be a rushdown (character who heavily plays on the offensive, closing in on the opponent and wailing down on them with attacks) or able to back off and zone (keep an opponent in certain areas) and if needed she has a single projectile that can have various properties allowing her to fight ranged.</p>
			<h1>How to Taokaka</h1>
			<p>Tao is the MOST versatile and agile character. Her Drive (a character specific ability/trait/attack) is called "Dancing Edge". Dancing Edge is a dash attack at very high speeds that delivers massive damage and allows Tao to either follow up or back off. Pressing a different direction and Drive, allows for many various jumps and dashes. This drive alone makes her the most agile character. Overal Tao hits fast and hits fairly hard, with various mix ups and being so tricky to tell what she is doing. Her supers are easy to combo into, and unlike alot of supers in the game, very easy to use outside of a combo to turn the tables. One super has her launching her self at her opponent and pinning them to the ground while she wails on them. This super is unblockable and hard to dodge. If at a distance, Tao has projectiles that can be either anti-air, chip damage or interuptors, and low heavy ones that while slow, can multi hit.</p>
			<h1>How I play Taokaka</h1>
			<p>When I play Taokaka, I play with her high speed, and be very offensive, trying to hit from every angle to keep my opponent on their toes. Being able to pounce onto my opponent and bounce away if needed is useful. The general logic I have is, if Drive connects, lead into combo strong, if drive is blocked, bounce away and use projectiles until I can land a drive. From there I will build super meter and then use supers when able to. Usually I try to leave enough super meter to do the aforementioned super as it is a great counter to many opposing moves, as well as a great finisher if your opponent is trying to play the ranged game due to them having low health.</p>
			<h1>The Pros and Cons of Taokaka</h1>
			<p>Tao is a very fast, agile and versatile character, which is a very big pro. She is able to get around the screen easily and quickly, and able to strike from many different angles making it easier to open and strike. Her biggest con, is the newest mechanic added to her called "Leg Cramp". Tao has a set of moves that follow the same directional input, and the attack is changed depending on what is pressed (A, B, or C) and these moves can chain into each other and do high damage. In the past this lead to some serious high value damaging combos, and this lead to Tao being very strong. This however made her too srong when it was exploited, so in order to balance this, the devs added "Leg cramp". Im not sure how this is activated, I believe it happens when a player tries to do too many chains of it, or reaches a certain amount of damage. The biggest issue of this, is that it not only forces Tao to drop her combo, BUT she also becomes vulnerable and open to be punished. It is hard to say if Tao is a balanced character because of this, but it does not matter as much with the next release, Blazblue Central Fiction, which should be coming out in North America early to middle of 2016, where all characters are either being revamped or heavily reworked.</p>
